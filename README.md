# NasaAPI Package
The objective of this API is to make NASA data, including imagery, eminently accessible to application developers.
* Domain: nasa.gov
* Credentials: apiKey

## How to get credentials: 
**You do not need to authenticate in order to explore the NASA data.**
However, if you will be intensively using the APIs to, say, support a mobile application, then you should sign up for a [NASA developer key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key).
